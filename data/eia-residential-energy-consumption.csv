"     1Consumption and expenditures for biomass (wood), coal, district steam, and solar thermal are excluded. 
     2Total U.S. includes all primary occupied housing units in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Vacant housing units, seasonal units, second homes, military houses, and group quarters are excluded.
     3Includes main (primary) and secondary space heating.      
     4Includes end uses not shown in this table. A more detailed breakout of end uses is shown in the Series 5 tables.
     5Housing units are classified using criteria created by the U.S. Census Bureau based on 2010 Census data. Urbanized areas are densely settled groupings of blocks or tracts with 50,000 or more people. Urban clusters have at least 2,500 but less than 50,000 people. All other areas are rural.
     6These climate regions were created by the Building America program, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).         
     7Rented includes households that occupy their primary housing units without paying rent.
     8Total square footage includes all basements, finished or conditioned (heated or cooled) areas of attics, and conditioned garage space that is attached to the home. Unconditioned and unfinished areas in attics and attached garages are excluded. The square footage for some housing units was calculated based on measurements taken by the interviewer. For households responding without the presence of an interviewer, square footage was imputed based on characteristics of the housing unit. See 2015 RECS Square Footage Methodology for full details about data collection and processing.
     Q = Data withheld because either the Relative Standard Error (RSE) was greater than 50% or fewer than 10 cases responded.
     N = No cases responded.
     Notes:  Because of rounding, data may not sum to totals.  See RECS Terminology for definition of terms used in these tables.
